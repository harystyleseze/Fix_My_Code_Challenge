# Fix My Code Challenge


This repository contains folders and files specifically created for the **FIX MY CODE CHALLENGE**.

The Fix My Code Challenge introduces a unique project format where participants focus on debugging existing code bases. Each challenge provides pre-written repositories serving as initial files for all solutions. The objective is to identify and resolve issues within the existing code, rather than generating new code from scratch.

ALX initiated this project, challenging participants with debugging tasks across a range of programming languages including C, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. These challenges encompass a diverse set of topics and scenarios, offering an opportunity for participants to enhance their debugging skills and become familiar with various codebases.
